General Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project was to make nachos handle user programs and
implement a memory allocator that would safely map physical pages of memory to
a virtual page for programs when they need to load.  This memory allocator also
needed to correctly free pages when a program finished.  To do this we created
our own MemoryAllocator class that took care of all these requirments.

As described in the write up for pa3 we did not have to implement page swapping.
This meant we had to limit when we loaded physical pages and had to make programs
wait when they couldn't load.  This process is described below in the section
explaining the modification to the UserProcess class.
